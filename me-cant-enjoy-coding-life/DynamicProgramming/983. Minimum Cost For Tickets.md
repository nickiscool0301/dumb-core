# Though process
- At any day, we can have a lot of options: get 1-day, 7-day or 30-day pass -> dynamic programming
- Let dp[x], is the minimum cost to cover the x-th day
- To reach x, can day buy 1-day from x-1, 7 day from x-7, 30 day from x-30 -> take the min of that
- Tips: to quickly check inbound for dp problem like x > 7 -> x-7. Can use dp[max(0, x-7)], dp[max(0, x-30)]


```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(days)
        days_set = set(days)
        if N == 1:
            return min(costs)
        
        last_day = days[-1]
        dp = [0] * (last_day + 1)
        
        for day in range(1,last_day+1):
            if day not in days_set:
                dp[day] = dp[day-1]
            else:
                dp[day] = min(
                    dp[max(0, day - 1)] + costs[0],
                    dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1],
                    dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])
                    
        return dp[last_day]
