Input:
Accounts table:

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

Output:


| category       | accounts_count |
|----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |


Explanation:
Low Salary: Account 2 -> x < 20000
Average Salary: No accounts. ->   20000 <= x <= 50000 
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8 -> x > 50000


### Think process
- use union all for each type of salary
- 3 querys and 2 union all

```sql
(SELECT "Low Salary" as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income < 20000) as accounts_count)
UNION ALL
(SELECT "Average Salary" as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income >= 20000 and income <= 50000) as accounts_count)
UNION ALL
(SELECT "High Salary" as category, (select count(*) from Accounts where income > 50000) as accounts_count)


```
