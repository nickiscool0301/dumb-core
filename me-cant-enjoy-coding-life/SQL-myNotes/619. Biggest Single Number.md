## Notes
- max(num) -> can help return null if the num inside is not existed
- Can solve with max or using sorting

### using max
```sql
SELECT MAX(num) as num FROM MyNumbers WHERE num IN (SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY num HAVING count(num) = 1)
```

### using sorting
```sql
SELECT (SELECT num FROM MyNumbers GROUP BY num HAVING count(num) = 1 ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1) as num
```
