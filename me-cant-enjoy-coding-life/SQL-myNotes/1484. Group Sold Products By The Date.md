Input:
Activities table:

| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|-------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |


Output:

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-Shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

## Think process
- to count num_sold -> COUNT(DISTINCT product) -> GROUP_BY sell_date
- ORDER BY sell_date
- Now to group the string for product name -> use GROUP_CONCAT 
- GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product order by product ASC separator ',') as products 

```sql
SELECT sell_date, count(DISTINCT product) as num_sold, 
GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product order by product ASC separator ',') as products 
FROM Activities GROUP BY sell_date ORDER BY sell_date ASC
```
