## Note
- use DATE_FORMAT(<column_name>, '%Y-%m') to format the date again
- the COUNT also count zero and num -> Better to use sum in this case
- IF(condition, <wanted value>, 0) check if state is approved then set to <wanted_value>. Otherwise set it to 0



```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(trans_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, country, count(*) AS trans_count, SUM(IF(state = 'approved',1, 0)) AS approved_count, SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount, SUM(IF(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) AS approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions GROUP BY country, month
```
