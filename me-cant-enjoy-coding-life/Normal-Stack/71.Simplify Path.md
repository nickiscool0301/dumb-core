# Thought process
- Need to keep track of each component between "/". When facing "..", need to pop the last valid component. Otherwise, will try to add the component
-> This lead to the idea of using a stack


```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for s in path.split("/"):
            # push
            if s != '' and s != '.' and s != '..':
                stack.append(s)
            # pop
            elif stack and s == '..':
                stack.pop()        
        res = "/" + "/".join(stack)
        return res
# TC: O(N)
# SC: O(N)
```
