# Thought process
- Greedy: to find minimum numbers of jump, just try to maximize all the possible jumps for each index. Try to maximize the furthest length that we can jump for each index -> How? -> furthest = max(furthest, i + nums[i])
- Then how can I detect if I need to make 1 more jumps -> if current index == current_end, when this happen, current_end will be the current furthest

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        farthest = 0
        current_end = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            farthest = max(farthest, nums[i] + i)
            if i == current_end:
                current_end = farthest
                res += 1
        return res
```
