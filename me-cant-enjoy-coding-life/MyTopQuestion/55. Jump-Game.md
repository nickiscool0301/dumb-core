# Think process

Let the goal is the last index.
We go from the end of array:
For each index, if that index + the maximum possible steps >= goal -> means we can easily hit the goal
Mark the current index to goal
After the loop, if goal == 0 -> True

```python
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        goal = len(nums) - 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2, -1,-1):
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                goal = i
        return goal == 0
```
