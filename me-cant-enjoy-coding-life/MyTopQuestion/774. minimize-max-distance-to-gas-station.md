# Thought process
- The station on x-axis is **SORTED** -> can think of binary search
- But how and what we binary search?
  - Want to minimize the maximum distance (gap) -> after adding k now stations -> all adj gaps should less than this maximum distance
  - Can reverse the thinking -> for specific distance, count how many k that actually make all the gaps less than that distance -> f(dist) <= k
  - Binary search on float -> need to use eps (1e-6)


```python
class Solution:
    def minmaxGasDist(self, stations: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        l,r = 0, stations[-1] - stations[0]
        eps = 1e-6
        ans = r
        
        def f(dist):
            count = 0
            for i in range(1,len(stations)):
                gap = stations[i] - stations[i-1]
                count += ceil(gap / dist) - 1
            return count
        
        while r - l >= eps:
            m = (r+l)/2
            if f(m) <= k:
                ans = m
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        return ans
```
